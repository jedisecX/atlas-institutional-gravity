# Methodology

## Goal
Construct a graph of public, documented institutional relationships between named persons
and major governance/finance institutions (UN and UN-adjacent bodies, central banks, IMF/WB/BIS, etc.).

## Relationship Rules
Edges are only created when a retrieved page contains relevant role phrases.
Each edge stores URL + snippet + confidence score.

## Non-Goals
No allegations. No guilt by association.
